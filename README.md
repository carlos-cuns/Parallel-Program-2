# Minotaur's Birthday Party

## Problem 1

Before the game, all of the guests come up with a solution with the following properties

- Every one is allowed one cupcake.
- One person (the announcer) is in charge of asking the servants to place a new cupcake
- That same person is in charge of counting the amount of times they make a request to the servants.
- Once the number of requests is equal to the number of guests - 1 (The announcer ate the first cupcake), they will announce to the minotaur that every guest has entered the labyrinth at least once.

This works because for every guest to have eaten one cupcake, they would have to enter the labyrinth.
